# Starcraft-2-Cat-N-Mouse-Red-Sea

  *Introduction
   Cat and Mouse is my favorite classic in Starcraft 1 Brood War. In particular, Fireworld was my most ###enjoyable map. It was not as competitive as Jungle and it was not as tricky as the Undead maps. This map is not meant ###for competitive, it is for fun. I hope it stays this way.

  *Who Am I?
   I am a senior and a rising graduate student major in Computer Science. I still play some games in my free time, but I spend most of time in learning new stuffs and working personal programming projects. Therefore, this map makes my two worlds happy.

  *Welcome
   This page is a list of things that I find useful for new players. I strongly suggest everyone to review my game on Starcraft 2. I welcome all feedback, they are important to the improvement of this map. With that said, I will try my best to update this map about once per month after I find this map "stable". I am working on a forum website for this map, I expect it to be done by summer of 2017. For now, you may report bugs by reviewing the map or email me **reallumingwu@gmail.com**.

#Guide
  *Basic rule:
   *Cats win by killing all the mice and Mice win by killing all the cats.
   *Mice have 50 starting mineral(cheese). As an exchange, the Cats get income as mineral per 5 seconds. This income will be doubled every 5 minutes, cap at 126 minerals per 5 seconds.
   *Cat gets mineral for killing Mouse structures and units.
   *Cat and Mouse can upgrade units, up to level 100.
   *If the only one Cat / Mouse of the player dies, all the units of the player on the map will be killed. 
   *When one team has no player having at least 1 Cat / Mouse, this team is defeated, the other team won.

  *Role selection:
   *The game is full game, 2 Cats vs 6 Mice, meaning 5 to 8 players.
   *The game is half game, 1 Cat vs 3 Mice, meaning 2 to 4 players.
   *Players may volunteer to be Cat.
   *If the desired Cat number will not be satisfied, the choosing players can only choose Cat.
   *If by the end of the selection, there are more players than the empty Cat seat, these seat will be filled randomly.

  *Basic tip:
   *Cat should have vision on the map, try to kill the Mice that are easy target.
   *If winning early game is not possible. Try to survive until late game, you are more powerful by then.
		
   *Mouse should build walls to buy time to prepare(kill Mouse Nest) escape.
   *Take advantage of environments like small gaps and Mouse Holes, Cats can't fit through them.
   *Make some units to punish Cat for rushing early units.
   *Upgrade your units.
   *Take advantage of the new Starcraft 2 pathing algorithm, Cat will get confused if you block roads.

  *Special feature:
   *If you play the map as a single player, you will enter developer test mode. You will be able to control 2 Mice and 2 Cats. Each of them have enough(a lot) mineral for you to test units.
